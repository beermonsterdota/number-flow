If set, NumberFlow applies [`will-change` properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/will-change) to relevant elements.
This can be useful if:
* Your number is guaranteed to change frequently
* You experience text misalignment when a transition completes

Note that "excessive use of `will-change` will result in excessive memory use" (source: [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/will-change)).
